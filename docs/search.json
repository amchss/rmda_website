You will learn to interpret the results and make data-driven conclusions.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nComplete all four questions using the low_birth_weight dataset.\nProvide a brief interpretation of your findings for each question.\nSave your report as a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Simple Linear Regression with Continuous Predictor\n\nExplore the relationship between birth weight (bwt) and mother’s weight (lwt).\nUse bwt as the dependent variable and lwt as the independent variable.\nFit a simple linear regression model.\nState the regression equation and interpret the coefficients:\nComment on the significance of the predictor.\n\n\n\nCode\nlm_bwt_lwt &lt;- lm(bwt ~ lwt, data = df)\nsummary(lm_bwt_lwt)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Simple Linear Regression with Categorical Predictor\n\nExplore the relationship between birth weight (bwt) and smoking status (smoke).\nUse bwt as the dependent variable and smoke as the independent variable.\nFit a simple linear regression model with smoke as a categorical predictor.\nState the regression equation and interpret the coefficients:\nDiscuss the significance of the predictor.\n\n\n\nCode\nlm_bwt_smoke &lt;- lm(bwt ~ smoke, data = df)\nsummary(lm_bwt_smoke)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Multiple Linear Regression with Continuous and Categorical Predictors\n\nExplore the relationship between birth weight (bwt), mother’s weight (lwt), and smoking status (smoke).\nUse lwt as the dependent variable, with both age (continuous) and smoke (categorical) as independent variables.\nFit a multiple linear regression model.\nState the regression equation and interpret the coefficients:\nDiscuss the significance of each predictor.\n\n\n\nCode\nlm_bwt_lwt_smoke &lt;- lm(bwt ~ lwt + smoke, data = df)\nsummary(lm_bwt_lwt_smoke)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Logistic Regression with Categorical Outcome\n\nExplore the relationship between low birth weight (low) and and race (race).\nUse low (binary outcome) as the dependent variable and race (categorical) as independent variables.\nFit a logistic regression model.\nReport the odds ratios and interpret the coefficients:(take exponential of coefficients exp(coef(model)))\nComment on the significance of each predictor.\n\nMandatory:\n\n# Recode 'low' variable to binary using dplyr\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(low = if_else(low == \"Normal\", 0, 1))\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    race = factor(race, levels = c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Others\")) # Reorder factor levels\n  )\n\n\n\nCode\n# Fit the logistic regression model using glm\nglm_low_birth_weight &lt;- glm(low ~  race, data = df, family = binomial)\n\n# Display the model summary\nsummary(glm_low_birth_weight)\n\nexp(coef(glm_low_birth_weight))",

In this exercise, you will learn how to handle data import and export in R, a fundamental skill for any data analysis project. You will start by downloading a sample dataset (low_birth_weight.csv), save it to your R Project folder, and then explore the different data formats commonly used in research. Following this, you will practice importing the dataset into R and exporting it in a different format (.rds). This exercise will help you understand how to efficiently manage datasets in R and prepare them for further analysis.

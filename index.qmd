## A Comprehensive Workshop on Research Methodologies & Data Analysis Using R

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
This website serves as a companion and reference material for the three-day workshop on *Research Methodologies & Data Analysis Using R*, organized by *IQRAA Calicut* in association with *AMCHSS, SCTIMST, Trivandrum* and the *Department of Surgery, Government Medical College, Kollam*, under the aegis of the *American Society for Microbiology*.The workshop will take place from **14th to 16th November 2024**.

The overall goal of this workshop is to introduce healthcare professionals to fundamental research methodologies and equip them with practical skills in data analysis using R. Participants will gain a solid understanding of statistical techniques, data visualization, and the use of R programming for reproducible research. Additionally, the workshop will explore how to create publication-ready tables and apply these methods to real-world healthcare data, with a special focus on epidemiological measures.

The workshop spans three days, combining interactive lectures to provide a comprehensive introduction to research methodologies and data analysis using R.

On Day One, the workshop begins with an inauguration session and an introduction to data science and R programming. The day will cover the fundamentals of research design, including research question formulation, types of research designs, and sample size estimation. The afternoon will introduce participants to digital data collection tools (ODK) and guide them through literature review strategies, along with the use of bibliographic software like Zotero. AT the end of the day the participants will become familiar with the R programming environment and RStudio interface, learning key features and layouts.

Day Two begins with a recap of the previous day. The morning session will focus on types of variables, project creation in R, and reading and writing data. Participants will also learn how to visualize data and explore different methods for analyzing it. The afternoon session will dive deeper into descriptive statistics, providing a solid foundation in numeric methods for data analysis. The day will conclude with an introduction to Quarto, enabling participants to create and export reports for their research findings.

Day Three starts with a recap and doubt clearance session. The focus then shifts to inferential statistics, where participants will learn about hypothesis testing and regression analysis. The morning will also cover the creation of publication-ready tables, which is essential for presenting research results in a professional format. The afternoon will provide an overview of epidemiological measures, ensuring that participants understand key metrics like incidence and prevalence. The workshop concludes with a feedback and valedictory session, offering participants a chance to clarify doubts and reflect on their learning experience.

### What is not covered in the workshop?

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
This workshop focuses on foundational concepts in research methodologies, data analysis, and spatial epidemiology using R. It does not cover advanced statistical or epidemiological methods in depth. While key aspects of regression analysis and hypothesis testing will be introduced, the workshop does not delve into specialized topics like advanced machine learning techniques or complex statistical modeling. Participants seeking more advanced training in these areas may consider future workshops, depending on demand.
